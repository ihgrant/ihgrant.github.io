For whatever reason I haven't been feeling the itch to code anything in my spare time lately, maybe because it's my job. When I do, my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ihgrant/museamp"&gt;Museamp&lt;/a&gt; project fulfills that need but lately I've been modeling &lt;a href="https://github.com/ihgrant/cities-assets"&gt;assets for Cities: Skylines&lt;/a&gt; using Blender.

For whatever reason I haven't been feeling the itch to code anything in my spare time lately, maybe because it's my job. When I do, my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ihgrant/museamp"&gt;Museamp&lt;/a&gt; project fulfills that need but lately I've been modeling &lt;a href="https://github.com/ihgrant/cities-assets"&gt;assets for Cities: Skylines&lt;/a&gt; using Blender. I used to hate Blender's interface, being used to Maya and to a lesser extent 3DS Max, but now that I've spent some time with it (and have spent several years having not used Maya), it's workable. Interfaces for 3d modeling software really have never solved the problem entirely and I think there's a lot of room for improvement still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago I released my first asset, &lt;a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693376948&amp;amp;searchtext=rico"&gt;a factory hall&lt;/a&gt; modeled after the Alcoa plant in Lafayette, IN. It was the first time I've ever publicly released a mod on Steam and it ended up being pretty popular, which was cool. I'm not generally the sort of person who seeks validation from others, but it's always nice to know that other people can appreciate the things you do for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm working on a few other assets - a large distribution center / warehouse and a replica of Portland's Steel Bridge, which is a really neat vertical-lift bridge that would look great in an industrial setting.&lt;/p&gt;

I've built this blog with Ghost and Buster and it's hosted in Github Pages under a domain name I own. This is great for me because I don't have to worry about exposing an admin interface to the web, everything is static so it loads quickly, and making new posts is still easy because I can fire up Ghost on my machine, write a new post, then compile and publish it to Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into a few pitfalls while working on the setup so I thought I'd mention them here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create your Github Pages repo first, and do it on the Github site! All you need to do is create a new repo called &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. Mine's &lt;code&gt;ihgrant.github.io&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have created the repo, install ghost on your machine locally. You'll end up with a directory full of folders like &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. Clone your github pages repo next to these, into a directory called &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;, like so: &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io.git static&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing buster can be confusing if you're not familiar with Python or its package manager (like me). Fortunately, although OS X does come with a recent version of Python installed, it does not have &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;, Python's package manager installed, even though if you installed Python yourself, pip would come with it. You can, however, get pip with Homebrew - and that's what I did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at this point, when you run &lt;code&gt;buster generate&lt;/code&gt; from your current directory (the one you installed ghost into) it'll populate that new &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; folder with the files for your static blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once that's done, all you need to do is run &lt;code&gt;buster deploy&lt;/code&gt; to commit those files to the repo and push it up to Github!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Akshit Khurana (&lt;a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster"&gt;https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster&lt;/a&gt;) for Buster, and Stefan Scherer (&lt;a href="https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-ghost-for-github-pages/"&gt;https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-ghost-for-github-pages/&lt;/a&gt;) and LED Technica (&lt;a href="http://ledtechnica.com/free-ghost-hosting-on-github-pages/"&gt;http://ledtechnica.com/free-ghost-hosting-on-github-pages/&lt;/a&gt;) for giving me extra info to figure out what I was doing wrong. There are a fair number of pieces to slot together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme is original and can be cloned or downloaded here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ihgrant/bl-ggn-theme"&gt;https://github.com/ihgrant/bl-ggn-theme&lt;/a&gt;. I'll be working on it off and on, I'm sure. There are still some rough edges, and I'd like to add syntax highlighting for code samples as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
