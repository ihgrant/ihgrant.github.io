            <p>It's been a long time since I published anything other than a portfolio on the web, but that ends today. I've built this blog with Ghost and Buster and it's hosted in Github Pages under a domain name I own. This is great for me because I don't have to worry about exposing an admin interface to the web, everything is static so it loads quickly, and making new posts is still easy because I can fire up Ghost on my machine, write a new post, then compile and publish it to Github.</p>

<p>I ran into a few pitfalls while working on the setup so I thought I'd mention them here:</p>

<ul>
<li>create your Github Pages repo first, and do it on the Github site! All you need to do is create a new repo called <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>. Mine's <code>ihgrant.github.io</code>.</li>
<li>Once you have created the repo, install ghost on your machine locally. You'll end up with a directory full of folders like <code>content</code>, <code>core</code>, and so on. Clone your github pages repo next to these, into a directory called <code>static</code>, like so: <code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git static</code></li>
<li>Installing buster can be confusing if you're not familiar with Python or its package manager (like me). Fortunately, although OS X does come with a recent version of Python installed, it does not have <code>pip</code>, Python's package manager installed, even though if you installed Python yourself, pip would come with it. You can, however, get pip with Homebrew - and that's what I did.</li>
<li>at this point, when you run <code>buster generate</code> from your current directory (the one you installed ghost into) it'll populate that new <code>static</code> folder with the files for your static blog.</li>
<li>Once that's done, all you need to do is run <code>buster deploy</code> to commit those files to the repo and push it up to Github!</li>
</ul>

<p>Special thanks to Akshit Khurana (<a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster</a>) for Buster, and Stefan Scherer (<a href="https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-ghost-for-github-pages/">https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-ghost-for-github-pages/</a>) and LED Technica (<a href="http://ledtechnica.com/free-ghost-hosting-on-github-pages/">http://ledtechnica.com/free-ghost-hosting-on-github-pages/</a>) for giving me extra info to figure out what I was doing wrong. There are a fair number of pieces to slot together!</p>

<p>The theme is original and can be cloned or downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/ihgrant/bl-ggn-theme">https://github.com/ihgrant/bl-ggn-theme</a>. I'll be working on it off and on, I'm sure. There are still some rough edges, and I'd like to add syntax highlighting for code samples as well.</p>
